The quote above is by the Mexican mathematician Guillermo Moreno (who I have never met).

I am another Mexican mathematician currently living in Ljubljana, Slovenia. I work as an assistant professor in the [Faculty of Mathematics and Physics](https://www.fmf.uni-lj.si/en/) of the [University of Ljubljana](https://www.uni-lj.si/en/university) and the [Faculty of Education](https://www.pef.uni-lj.si/en/home-page/) of the same university.

My research interests are around the symmetry properties of discrete objects, such as polyhedra, polytopes, maps on surfaces, graphs and their generalisations. As a consequence, I have developed certain attraction to pretty combinatorial and geometrical objects. I am also interested in the use of technologies to create math content for research, teaching or just as part of the academic life (this website is an example of it).

In more of a personal note, I am a coffee nerd: I enjoy not only brewing and drinking delicious coffee but also learning about the process as much as I can. I have been attracted to music my entire life; this attraction has taken several shapes through out the years: I can find my way around several instruments but I am not particularly gifted in any of them. I am also interested in music production. 

I also have a tendency to write my and share my ideas. My [personal blog](https://anteromontonio.github.io/blog/) is hosted on this website; I would appreciate if you look around.

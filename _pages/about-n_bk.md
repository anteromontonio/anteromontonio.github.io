The quote above is by the Mexican mathematician Guillermo Moreno (who I have never met).

I am another Mexican mathematician currently living in Ljubljana, Slovenia. I work as a research assistant (postdoc) in the [Faculty of Mathematics and Physics](https://www.fmf.uni-lj.si/en/) of the [University of Ljubljana](https://www.uni-lj.si/en/university). I also have a teaching position in the [Faculty of Education](https://www.pef.uni-lj.si/en/home-page/) of the same university.


My research interests are around the symmetry properties of discrete objects, such as polyhedra, polytopes, maps on surfaces, graphs and their generalisations. As a consequence, I have developed certain attraction to pretty combinatorial and geometrical objects. Recently and thanks to my last teaching adventure, I discovered that I am interested also in the use of technologies to create mathematical contents (such as LaTeX, GeoGebra and this website).

In more of a personal note, I am a coffee nerd: I enjoy not only brewing and drinking delicious coffee but also learning about the process as much as I can. My entire life I have been attracted to the music and that has taken different shapes: I can find my way around several instruments but I am not particularly gifted in any of them. I am also interested in music production.

This website is still under construction and hopefully it will become a space for me to share something slightly wider than my academic profile.
